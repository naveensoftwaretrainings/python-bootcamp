4. Interview Coding Problems and Practice
   - Solving coding problems frequently asked in interviews
   - Practice and implementation of algorithms and data structures
   - Analyzing and optimizing code efficiency

For the interview coding problems, here are a few examples:

1. Problem: Reverse a String
   Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of the string. For example, if the input is "hello," the output should be "olleh."

2. Problem: Palindrome Check
   Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward), and False otherwise.

3. Problem: Two Sum
   Given an array of integers and a target sum, write a Python function that returns indices of two numbers such that they add up to the target sum. You may assume that each input has exactly one solution.

Problem: Fibonacci Series
Write a Python function that takes a positive integer as input and returns a list containing the Fibonacci series up to that number. The Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. For example, if the input is 8, the output should be [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8].

Problem: Anagram Check
Write a Python function that takes two strings as input and returns True if they are anagrams (contain the same characters in a different order), and False otherwise. For example, if the inputs are "listen" and "silent," the output should be True.

Problem: Prime Number Check
Write a Python function that takes a positive integer as input and returns True if it is a prime number, and False otherwise. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
